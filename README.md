# arm-toolchain
ARM toolchain build script with multilib support for relevant ARM CPUs, FPUs, and ABIs.

## Usage

Just type make

The script will download the required source code for each component before it begins the build.

Once the source code is downloaded, the compile time is about 30 minutes on my computer (Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-6700K CPU @ 4.00GHz).
